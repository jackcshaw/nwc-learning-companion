- sources/source-spine.md
- patterns/nwc-ai-enabled-learning-workflows.md
- cases/cyber-group-strategy-transfer-case.md
- artifacts/traceable-learning-artifact.md

Do not answer from the essay alone. Use the repo to help me do one useful thing with the argument.

Start by giving me:
1. the cleanest version of the core claim;
2. the part of the argument most relevant to an NWC instructor or curriculum leader;
3. the most useful starter prompt from the repo for my next step.

If I ask to inspect evidence, read claims.md and sources/source-spine.md. If I ask to design an exercise, read cases/cyber-group-strategy-transfer-case.md and artifacts/traceable-learning-artifact.md. If I ask to argue with the essay, read prompts/objections-and-responses.md.

If you cannot access GitHub directly, tell me the smallest set of repo files you need me to paste before you continue.`;

      This guide is for faculty and curriculum leaders who want to pressure-test
      the argument before turning it into a pilot. It explains what the companion
      and workbench are for, what instructors should shape, and how the package
      turns the essay into a useful object for critique.

      <h3>Use the essay as the object of practice first.</h3>
      <p>
        The companion should not begin with an adjacent assignment. It should
        first ask readers to interrogate the essay itself. That makes the paper
        both the argument and the demonstration: identify the frame, find the
        assumptions, pressure-test objections, and decide what the teaching
        implications would actually require.

      <h3>Move from argument to real NWC work.</h3>
      <p>
        After the essay has been mapped, the method transfers to an approved
        NWC-style artifact. The right artifact has enough ambiguity to expose
        problem framing, political aims, assumptions, risks, evidence standards,
        and reliance decisions.
